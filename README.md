# Svsync

This project provides a tool for one-way, efficient file synchronization from source to target. Unlike other file synchronization solutions, this tool supports multiple storage types (see below currently supported types) and can sync files between any combination of these types.

#Features
  * 100% cross-platform

  You can run it on Windows, Linux, Mac OSX or Raspberry Pi smoothly with exactly the same binaries.

  * Supports multiple storage types
    
	Currently supported
      * Local storage
	  * SMB (Windows) network share
	  * Amazon S3
	  * Microsoft Azure Blobs
	  
  * Declarative approach
    
	Just list your sources and targets (i.e. what needs to be synced and where) in XML file that defines a working profile. Svsync will take it from there.

  * Multithreading
	
	Svsync utilizes multithreading to perform some of its tasks in parallel.
  
  * Smart synchronization
    
	This tools uses a non-standard approach to file synchronization. Rather than immediately synchronizing files folder by folder, it first scans both source and target to get a full view of all the files. Then, it analyzes the changes minimizing the amount of data to be copied. For example, if you have already uploaded your 500GB video library to Azure blob, and then you accidentally change the name of the folder from "movies" to "videos", svsync will be smart enough to just move the files to a new location at the target, rather than re-uploading all the files again.
  
  * Advanced file-skipping capabilities
	
	Svsync provides an ability to skip any subfolders within a synced folder. In addition, you can use regular expressions on full file path to decide which files you want and which you don't. For example, you want to upload your photos library to S3, but you want to skip all the Thumbs.db files created by Windows, in order to save space at a target.  
  
#Use Scenarios
  * Sync your stuff from home NAS to Amazon S3 once a day for disaster recovery.
    
	You can choose only critical stuff, rather than all your files, paying only for storage taken at S3.
  
  * Sync large amount of data from your pc to an external drive once in a while.
    
	No need to copy all data over and over again, just sync the differences from the last time.
  
  * Sync up your work files at the end of the day to a network share for backup.
    
	You can use Windows scheduled tasks or cron job to automate the runs.
